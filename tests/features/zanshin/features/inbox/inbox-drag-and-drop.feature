Feature: Inbox task association
  As someone collecting tasks
  I can associate a task to another one
  In order to deal with complex tasks requiring several steps

  Scenario: Dropping a task on another one makes it a child
    Given I display the "Inbox" page
    And there is an item named "Buy apples" in the central list
    When I drop the item on "Errands" in the central list
    And I list the items
    Then the list is:
