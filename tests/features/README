These tests use the ruby "cucumber" application.

You can install it with distro packages or with `gem install cucumber` as root.

The tests are run as part of `ctest` (or `make test`), but when debugging
you can also run them separately, e.g.

$ cd <builddir>/zanshin/tests/features/zanshin

Run all zanshin tests -- stop at first failure:
$ ./tests-features-zanshin

Run all zanshin tests -- keep going in case of failure:
$ ./tests-features-zanshin -k

Run only specific tests, useful when debugging or developing new tests:
$ ./tests-features-zanshin features/editing/adding-task.feature features/editing/editing-task.feature
