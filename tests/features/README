These tests use the ruby "cucumber" application.

You can install it with distro packages or with `gem install cucumber` as root.

The tests are run as part of `ctest` (or `make test`), but when debugging
you can also run them separately, e.g.

Run all tests:
$ ./zanshin-features-run

Run all tests and stop at first error:
$ ./zanshin-features-run --fail-fast

Run only specific tests, useful when debugging or developing new tests:
$ ./zanshin-features-run --fail-fast features/editing/adding-task.feature features/editing/editing-task.feature
