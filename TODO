* Better date handling (e.g. typing "tomorrow" or "next monday" does the right thing).
* Complete the configuration dialog to allow adding/removing resources.
* Anti-procrastination feature (if you postpone a task too many times popup a dialog asking what to do)
* Allows for task/project/context sorting
* Use the start date field, and hide actions which have a start date in the future (probably requires an
  extra mode to take a look at those actions).
* Proper error handling
* Undo/redo support
